* 'VAT Report' is valid only for cases where it's met that for each
  Tax defined: all the "Account tags" of all the
  'Repartition for Invoices' or 'Repartition for Credit Notes'
  are different.
* It would be nice to have in reports a column indicating the
  state of the entries when the option "All Entries" is selected
  in "Target Moves" field in a wizard
* Adapt reports so that the order of the columns displayed is dynamic
* Remove duplicated options to show columns (it has not been made in a stable version so
  as not to generate confusion in users)
